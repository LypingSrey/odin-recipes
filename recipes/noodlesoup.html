    <h2>Food Description</h2>
    <p>Cambodian Phnom Penh Noodle Soup, also known as Keiv Teav Phnom Penh, is a renowned dish in Cambodia, particularly favored for breakfast. This flavorful soup features a hot pork broth simmered with pork bone, dried shrimps, dried squids, fresh daikon, grilled onion, and various spices. The broth, a labor-intensive process that involves hours or overnight cooking, is a key element, often prepared a day in advance.</p>
    <p>The broth includes ingredients like pork bone, pork shoulder (or pork butt or loin), grilled onions, daikon radish, dried shrimps, dried squids, rock sugar, garlic, star anise, black or white peppercorns, salt, fish sauce, and water. This mixture is simmered for an extended period to extract the rich flavors. The meats for the soup, including thinly sliced pork shoulder, pork liver, ground pork, and cooked shrimps, are prepared separately and set aside.</p>
    <p>When serving the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup, the clear broth is heated to a boil, and the noodles (either fresh or dried) are cooked separately. The cooked noodles are placed in a large soup bowl, topped with the prepared meats, and covered with the hot broth. Garnishes like bean sprouts, cilantro, green onions, saw tooth coriander, and lettuce add freshness and texture. The soup is further enhanced with a flavor sauce consisting of minced fried shallots and garlic with oil, Sriracha hot chili sauce, hoisin sauce, and black pepper. Lime wedges are provided for an extra burst of citrusy flavor.</p>

    <h2>Directions to make Cambodian Phnom Penh Noodle Soup</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You have to parboil the bone wash and clean. In a big soup pot bring enough water to boil then add pork bone. Boil for 5 minutes on high heat then drain and wash the bone set aside, this will keep the broth clear, clean the pot.</li>
        <li>Now put 20 cups of water in the soup pot and turn the heat on high until the water is boiling then add the bone, pork shoulder and the rest of the ingredients into the boiling pot. Cook for 20 minutes on medium high heat then reduce the heat to low or simmer for 1 ½ hours to 2 hours. Do adjust everything to your taste bud. (Make sure you take out the pork shoulder ahead of time if you cook it too long the meat will be very tuff to chew on)</li>
        <li>When the soup is done take the bone out sliced any meat your want off the bone. Drain the broth and discharge everything else, put the clear broth back in the pot and set aside until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>For the noodle you can use fresh or dried Phnom Penh noodle if you use dried noodle make sure you soaked wash and drain the water then cook in hot boiling water for a minute or so. For Fresh noodle I also soak it for about 5 minutes in warm water so it cooks fast in boiling water. Do use strainer with handle to cook the noodle in hot boiling water. (Don’t cook it until you ready to eat or else the noodle will stick together.</li>
